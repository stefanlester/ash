											  director, manager or accountant of the Company, whose capacity need not be
											  qualified, as to any amount owed by the Renter to the Company shall
											  constitute prima facie proof of the amount due and payable by the Renter to
											  the Company.
											</p>
											<p>10.RENTER’S RISKS AND LIABILITIES</p>
											<p>
											  10.1. The Vehicle is rented at the sole risk of the Renter and/or driver(s)
											  (fair wear and tear excepted) from the moment the key and/or the Vehicle is
											  handed to the Renter until such time as the key and/or Vehicle is returned
											  to the Company.
											</p>
											<p>
											  10.2. The Renter shall be solely responsible and liable for any and all
											  damages and/or total loss sustained to the Vehicle, howsoever the damage
											  and/or total loss is caused and whether or not it is attributable to the
											  Renter and/or driver(s) his fault or negligence (including but not limited
											  to hail damage and or any force majeure event).
											</p>
											<p>
											  10.3. If contracted for, the Renter will only be liable for the amount
											  indicated as the applicable excess (provided there was no breach of any
											  conditions) and a damage claim handling fee equal to twenty percent the
											  value of the damages. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Renter
											  shall be liable for any amounts not covered by the Company insurers in
											  particular for incidents (exclusions) that fall outside of the insurance
											  cover provided by the Company’s insurers.
											</p>
											<p>
											  10.4. The Company, in its sole and absolute discretion, reserves the right
											  to, in the event of loss or damage which has occurred in a situation where
											  no physical contact is made with another vehicle or animal or object or
											  person (in or on the road surface), charge the Renter either the actual
											  amount of the loss or damage suffered or double the liability amount
											  reflected on the Rental Agreement (whichever is greater).
											</p>
											<p>
											  10.4.1 The Company, in its sole and absolute discretion, reserves the right
											  to, in the event of loss or damage which has occurred between 1am and 6am in
											  the morning to charge the Renter the actual loss or damage suffered or
											  double the liability amount reflected on the Rental Agreement (whichever is
											  greater).
											</p>
											<p>
											  10.4.2 The Company, in its sole and absolute discretion, reserves the right
											  to, in the event of loss or damage where the renter was driving 30
											  kilometres per hour or more above the speed limit (reckless and negligent
											  driving) charge the Renter either the actual amount of the loss or damage
											  suffered or double the liability amount reflected on the Rental Agreement
											  (whichever is greater). (The speed recorded on the vehicles tracker will
											  suffice as proof of the speed driven).
											</p>
											<p>
											  10.4.3. The Company, in its sole and absolute discretion, reserves the right
											  to, in the event of loss or damage which has occurred in a situation where
											  the driver had fled the scene of the accident to charge the Renter the
											  actual loss or damage suffered or double the liability amount reflected on
											  the Rental Agreement (whichever is greater).
											</p>
											<p>
											  10.5. Should the Vehicle be damaged, stolen or lost in a situation where
											  there was a breach of any of the terms and conditions as contained herein or
											  the Rental Agreement, and/or excluded from the Company’s insurance cover,
											  the Renter shall be liable for the total loss and/or damage suffered by the
											  Company.
											</p>
											<p>
											  10.6. The Renter and/or drivers, are liable for all fines and/or penalties
											  incurred during the Rental Period and hereby authorises the Company to
											  disclose any information required by a relevant authority to process it.
											</p>
											<p>
											  10.7. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Company shall not be
											  obliged to make, institute, or proceed with any claim or legal action, which
											  the Company may otherwise have had against a third party for the recovery of
											  any loss or damage to or in connection with the Vehicle and, accordingly,
											  the Company shall be entitled, in its fair and reasonable discretion, to
											  abandon such claim or to settle such claim on any terms. The Company’s
											  election not to pursue any claims is in no way to be deemed to be a waiver
											  of the Company’s rights to recover all such amounts due to the Company from
											  Renter occasioned as a result of any such claims that the Company has
											  elected not to proceed with.
											</p>
											<p>11.CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES</p>
											<p>
											  The Renter will be liable, in addition to any other amount provided for in
											  the Rental Agreement, for damages suffered by the Company in consequence of
											  it being unable to rent the Vehicle, which damages will be calculated on the
											  basis of the contracted daily rate on the Rental Agreement or on the
											  official rates brochure for the period that the Vehicle was inoperative
											  limited to a maximum of 30 days, limited only by any legal limitation
											  imposed by any relevant legislation regulating the amount claimable for
											  consequential damages.
											</p>

											</p>
											<p>
											  12.4. The Renter and/or driver(s) warrant that the information completed in
											  the Company’s claim form as referred to in 12. 1.1 will be complete, true

											</p>
											<p>

											</p>
											<p>14.JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY OF SIGNATORIES, RENTER AND/OR DRIVER(S)</p>
											<p>
											  The Renter and every person whose signature appears on the Rental Agreement

											  pursuant to the Rental Agreement.
											</p>
											<p>15.GENERAL</p>
											<p>
											  15.1. The Rental Agreement, incorporating these terms and conditions, is the
											  entire agreement between the Company and Renter and/or driver(s) regarding
											  the matters contained herein and neither party shall be bound by any
											  undertakings, representations, warranties, assurances, promises or the like
											  (other than the Company, in its soles discretion extending the Rental Period
											  on the terms recorded in these terms and conditions) not recorded by the
											  Company except as provided for herein. Nothing in this clause shall limit or
											  exclude any liability for fraud.
											</p>
											<p>
											  &nbsp;15.2. Any provision of this Rental Agreement, which is found or held
											  to be invalid, unlawful or unenforceable, shall be severable from the
											  remaining terms of this Agreement, and treated as pro non scripto. The
											  remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain valid and enforceable.
											  The Parties agree to meet and review the matter and if any valid, lawful,
											  and enforceable means are reasonably available to achieve the same object as
											  the invalid, unlawful or unenforceable provision, to negotiate and agree to
											  adopt such means by way of variation and / or amendment in good faith.
											</p>
											<p>
											  15.3. No extension, latitude or other indulgence that may be given or are
											  allowed by any party in respect of performance of any obligation hereunder,
											  and no delay or forbearance in the enforcement of any right of any party
											  arising from this Rental Agreement, and no single or partial exercise of any
											  right by any party under this Rental Agreement will in any circumstances be
											  construed as implied consent or election by such party or operate as a
											  waiver or a novation of or otherwise affect any party’s rights in terms of
											  or arising from this rental agreement or stop or preclude any such party
											  from enforcing at any time and without notice, strict and punctual
											  compliance with each and every provision or term hereof.
											</p>
											<p>
											  15.4. The Renter authorises the Company to insert any particulars in the
											  Rental Agreement that are not known or are unavailable at the time of
											  signature of the Rental Agreement as and when the particulars become
											  available.
											</p>
											<p>
											  15.5. This agreement and all matters or disputes arising there from or
											  incidental thereto shall be governed and construed in accordance with the
											  laws of the Republic of South Africa.
											</p>
											<p>
											  15.6. The Renter further consents to the jurisdiction of the Magistrate’s
											  Court, should the Company, at its election, bring legal proceedings against
											  the Renter and/or driver(s), notwithstanding the fact that the amount
											  involved exceeds the jurisdiction of the Magistrate’s Court. The Renter
											  agrees, however, that the Company in its sole and absolute discretion may
											  institute any such action or proceedings in any division of the High Court
											  that may have jurisdiction.
											</p>
											<p>
											  15.7. The Renter shall not be entitled to cede delegate or assign any of his
											  rights or assign any of his obligations under this Rental Agreement or to
											  rent or part with possession of the Vehicle, its tools or equipment or any
											  part of the Vehicle for any purpose whatsoever outside of the terms of the
											  Rental Agreement. The Company shall be entitled to cede delegate or assign
											  any of the Company’s rights or assign any of the company’s obligations under
											  this Rental Agreement to a third party without notice to the Renter.
											</p>
											<p>
											  15.8. If the company institutes any legal proceedings against the Renter to
											  enforce any of its rights under this Rental Agreement it shall be entitled
											  to recover from the Renter all the legal costs incurred by the Company’s
											  attorneys in accordance with their charges and assessed as between attorney
											  and own client including but not limited to collection commission and
											  tracing agent charges and all other ancillary disbursements incurred by the
											  Company’s attorneys.
											</p>
											<p>
											  15.9. The Parties choose as their respective domicilium citandi et
											  executandi (“domicilium”), for the purposes of giving any written notice
											  arising from this Agreement, the physical addresses and e-mail addresses set
											  out in the Rental Agreement, with the physical addresses provided by the
											  Company and the Renter in the Rental as being the respective Parties chosen
											  domicilium citandi et executandi for purposes of service of legal process.
											</p>
											<p>
											  15.10. Either Party shall be entitled from time to time by written notice to
											  the other Party, vary its domicilium address to any other physical address
											  within the Republic of South Africa, which is not a post office box or poste
											  restante.
											</p>
											<p>
											  15.11. Any written notice required and/or permitted to be given by either
											  Party in terms of this Agreement shall be, valid and effective only if in
											  writing, and deemed to have been duly given (i) 7 days after posting, if
											  posted by prepaid registered post to either the Party’s physical address
											  and/or postal address above, or (ii) on date of delivery, if delivered by
											  hand during normal working hours (08H00 – 17H00), or (iii) in the absence of
											  proof to the contrary, within one hour of sending an e-mail where the e-mail
											  is sent during normal business hours of the recipient party and within two
											  hours of the commencement of the following business day where it is sent
											  outside of normal business hours.
											</p>
											<p>
											  15.12. The Renter consents to the Company carrying out a credit and criminal
											  record check on a Renter and/or driver(s), with one or more credit agencies
											  and SAPS who may retain a record thereof and the Company shall be entitled
											  to record any default by the Renter with any credit agency and relevant
											  authorities. Such records may be made available by the credit agency to
											  third parties, in which case the Company shall not be held
											  liable/responsible for any repercussions such disclosure may have on the
											  Renter. The Renter agrees that the company may disclose any information
											  obtained by it as a result of the conclusion and/or breach of the Rental
											  Agreement, including personal and additional information, to any person,
											  including a credit bureau.
											</p>
											<p>
											  15.13. The Renter acknowledges that certain vehicles may be fitted with a
											  vehicle management system, which is used to inter alia, record speed and
											  other information relating to the vehicle rented. The Company shall be
											  entitled to use such information (including in court proceedings) as it
											  deems fit.
											</p>
											<p>
											  15.14. It is recorded that this agreement is exempt from the provisions of
											  National Credit Act and Consumer Protection Act as the Rental Agreement does
											  not amount to a credit agreement as defined in the National Credit Act
											  and/or Consumer Protection Act. The Company is not providing credit
											  facilities to the Renter and is not required to be registered as credit
											  provider in terms of the National Credit Act.
											</p>
											<p>
											  15.15. The Renter renounces the legal exceptions non numeratae pecuniae,
											  non-causa debiti, error calculi, revision of accounts and no value received,
											  and to waive the benefit of excussion.
